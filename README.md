## Description


Material-trader is a Full-stack applications, with a git branching workflow.
The purpose of our app is to help our planet be more ecofriendly, but it can’t do it alone. The earth needs our help to do so. This is what we can do to reduce, reuse, and recycle. How is this possible you may ask? Just go to our app sign up so you can start recycling. You can upload pictures to your profile all the materials you no longer use and add a brief description about your material. This can be as small as batteries to concrete, aluminum, and much more. There are no fees at all its free. Once you upload the picture and description anyone can see what you posted and be on their way to pick up the material they may need, and you don’t longer need. It’s as simple as that, so come let’s start to make a better place for our earth
